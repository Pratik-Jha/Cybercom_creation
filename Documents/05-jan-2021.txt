Today i will practise some git command i.e.

1)git push: Which is used for pushing the file and folder into the Repositary.
2)git commit: It will commit the file or folder which is not commited and if we want to pass some message with it we use -m syntax with it and after that in the double quote we write the message
	Synatx:- git commit -m "message".
3)git add filename: By using this syntax we add the untracked file.
4)gti status: By using this syntax we track the file and the file which is untracked we add that file using this("git add filename") syntax.
5)git clone: By using this syntax we clone the project in our local machine where we want.
6)git fetch: By using this syntax we get the updated deatils of repo.
7)git merge: By using this syntax we merge the one brach into the main branch.


Apart from that i have also learn that how to create a folder using the command promt using "mkdir" syntax adn how to move form one folder to anoter folder using the command promt.

While doing this thing i get stuck or get error in one place i.e. copy the SSH key from command promt so to resolve that i run that syntax in the GIT BASH promt so in that it will properly run.

Today Chirag sir also assign me one responsibilty to solve a query of one Trainee so i also solve and resolver his query.

And also Chirag sir assign one work to make repository with the company name an in that we have to make 3 folders.
