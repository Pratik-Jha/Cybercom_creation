# Precedence 
	-> This determines the way in which operators are given priority amongst each other. An operator with higher precedence is evaluated before an operator of lower precedence.

# Associativity 
	-> This determines the way in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated.
# Class
	-> Firstly this is not an object its a templates which is used to encapsulate all the information or code in one place.
	-> We can declare class by two ways
		1) By using class keyword.
		   class Square{
  			constructor(length) {
    				this.length = length;    				
  			}
		  }
		
		2) By using class expression:
			let square =class {
				constructor(length) {
    				this.length = length;    				
  				}
			}
	-> Constructor is the special method in a class which is used to creating and initializing an object created with a class and we 		can't create more then one constructor.
	
-> See the use of static method in class. when we use static method in class so it simply attached to the class not to the instance of the 	class.
-> Also see how to apply inheritance in class we can apply by using the extends keyword.
-> See the uses of "use strict" in javaScript.
